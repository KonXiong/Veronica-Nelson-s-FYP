This program contains an FDTD algorithm (adopted from A. Z. Elsherbeni, The finite-difference time-domain method for electromagnetics with MATLABÂ® simulations, Second edition. Edison, New Jersey: SciTech Publishing, 2015.) to simulate the propagation of VLF waves in the Earth-Ionosphere waveguide.
